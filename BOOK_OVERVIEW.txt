1. Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari
Sapiens explores the entire span of human history, from the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa to the modern age. Harari presents a narrative that examines how biology, anthropology, and economics have shaped the human species.

The book presents controversial insights about capitalism, consumerism, and industrialization. Harari also critiques how modern humans treat animals and the environment. By blending history with science, he makes readers question what it means to be human. He highlights how Homo sapiens outcompeted other species like Neanderthals. Through this, he shows the power of imagination and language. He also explores the future of humanity in a world of artificial intelligence and biotechnology. His storytelling mixes academic insight with engaging anecdotes. Though not all historians agree with Harari’s interpretations, his ability to simplify complex ideas is widely praised.
